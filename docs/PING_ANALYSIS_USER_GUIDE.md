# Ping Analysis - User Guide

## Quick Start

### Access the Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Data Management** in the sidebar
2. Click **Ping Analysis**
3. The dashboard will load with default settings (last 30 days, all verticals)

---

## Understanding the Two Tabs

### Tab 1: Same-Vertical Rejections

**What it shows**: Leads that were REJECTED because we already had that phone number in the same vertical within 30 days.

**Data Status**: 
- ‚è≥ **Starts fresh from today** - Data collection began when this feature was deployed
- üìà **Check back in 24-48 hours** for initial data
- üìä **Full analytics in 7-14 days** with meaningful volume

**How to use it**:
1. Wait for data to accumulate
2. Look for lists with high duplicate rates (>20% is concerning)
3. Click the expand arrow (‚ñ∂) on rows to see which other lists they conflict with
4. Export to CSV for detailed analysis
5. Contact partners about data quality issues

**Example Insights**:
- "List A has 35% duplicate rate - mostly conflicts with List B"
- "Partner X is sending leads we already purchased"
- "Average time between duplicate attempts: 8 days"

---

### Tab 2: Cross-Vertical Duplicates

**What it shows**: Leads that were ACCEPTED despite having duplicate phone numbers because they came from different verticals.

**Data Status**:
- ‚úÖ **Ready NOW** - Historical data available immediately
- üìä **10,047 phones** with cross-vertical duplicates (last 7 days)
- üîç **Shows data source contamination**

**How to use it**:
1. Review list pairs with high phone overlap
2. Identify partners selling same leads to multiple verticals
3. Understand cross-vertical contamination patterns
4. Use sample phones to verify specific cases
5. Export for partner quality discussions

**Example Insights**:
- "Partner X Medicare list shares 250 phones with their Final Expense list"
- "ACA List A has 15% phone overlap with Medicare List B"
- "Same consumers being targeted across multiple verticals"

---

## Using the Filters

### Date Range
- **Default**: Last 30 days
- **Recommended**: 
  - Use 7 days for recent trends
  - Use 30 days for comprehensive analysis
  - Same-Vertical: More days = more data (as it accumulates)
  - Cross-Vertical: More days = slower queries (start with 7 days)

### Vertical Filter
- **All**: Shows data across all verticals
- **ACA**: Filter to only ACA vertical
- **Medicare**: Filter to only Medicare vertical  
- **Final Expense**: Filter to only Final Expense vertical

**When to use**: Focus analysis on specific vertical for targeted insights

### Minimum Duplicate Rate
- **0%**: Show all lists (default)
- **5%**: Show only concerning lists
- **10%**: Show problematic lists
- **20%+**: Show severe quality issues

**Recommendation**: Start with 0% to see full picture, then increase to focus on problems

## Understanding the Metrics

### Same-Vertical Rejections Tab

| Column | Meaning | Good | Concerning |
|--------|---------|------|------------|
| **Total Pings** | Accepted + Rejected attempts | High volume | - |
| **Accepted** | Successfully processed leads | High | - |
| **Duplicates** | Rejected duplicate attempts | Low | High |
| **Dupe Rate** | % of pings that were duplicates | <5% | >20% |
| **Unique Phones** | Distinct phone numbers rejected | - | High count |
| **Avg Days** | Days between original and duplicate | Higher | Lower (<7 days) |

**What to look for**:
- üü¢ Green rates (<5%): Excellent data quality
- üü° Yellow rates (5-20%): Monitor closely
- üî¥ Red rates (>20%): Quality issue, contact partner

### Cross-Vertical Duplicates Tab

| Column | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **List A** | First list with the phone |
| **List B** | Second list with same phone |
| **Shared Phones** | How many phone numbers appear in both |
| **Total Overlaps** | Total number of duplicate occurrences |
| **Sample Phones** | Example phone numbers for verification |

**What to look for**:
- High shared phone counts between same partner's different vertical lists
- Unexpected overlaps between different partners
- Patterns suggesting data source quality issues

## Taking Action Based on Data

### High Duplicate Rate in Same List

**Problem**: List A has 30% duplicate rate

**Steps**:
1. Click expand arrow to see which lists it conflicts with
2. If mostly one list ‚Üí Check if lists should be deduplicated
3. If spread across many lists ‚Üí Partner data quality issue
4. Contact partner with specific numbers and timeframes
5. Consider adjusting bid or pausing list temporarily

### High Cross-Vertical Overlap

**Problem**: Medicare List A shares 200 phones with Final Expense List B

**Steps**:
1. Check if both lists are from same partner (common)
2. If yes ‚Üí Expected, consumers interested in multiple products
3. If no ‚Üí Data sharing between partners (investigate)
4. Review sample phones to verify pattern
5. Consider if targeting same consumers across verticals makes business sense

### Identifying Data Quality Issues

**Red Flags**:
- Duplicate rate >30% consistently
- Duplicates occurring within 1-3 days (scraping/bot behavior)
- Same phones across many unrelated lists
- Sudden spike in duplicate rate for previously clean list

**Actions**:
1. Export CSV with problematic data
2. Document specific examples
3. Schedule call with partner
4. Request data source audit
5. Implement quality gates or reduce bid

## Export & Reporting

### CSV Export

**Same-Vertical**:
- Includes all table columns
- One row per list
- Top matched lists in separate columns
- Import into Excel/Google Sheets for pivot tables

**Cross-Vertical**:
- Includes list pair information
- One row per list pair with overlap
- Sample phones included
- Use for partner communications

### Creating Reports

**Weekly Report Example**:
1. Set date range to last 7 days
2. Export both tabs to CSV
3. Sort by duplicate rate (descending)
4. Share top 10 problematic lists with team
5. Track improvements week-over-week

---

## Best Practices

### Daily
- Quick check of summary cards
- Note overall duplicate rate trend
- Watch for sudden spikes

### Weekly
- Review top 10 lists by duplicate rate
- Check cross-vertical patterns
- Export data for team review
- Document findings

### Monthly
- Comprehensive analysis across all verticals
- Partner quality scorecards
- Trend analysis (improving vs. degrading)
- Adjust list routing strategies based on insights

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why is Tab 1 empty?**  
A: Data collection started when this feature was deployed. Check back in 24-48 hours.

**Q: Can I see historical same-vertical rejection data?**  
A: No, rejected leads were never stored before this feature. Only new rejections are tracked.

**Q: Why does Tab 2 have data immediately?**  
A: Cross-vertical duplicates are ACCEPTED leads already in the database. We can analyze them retroactively.

**Q: What's a "good" duplicate rate?**  
A: <5% is excellent, 5-15% is acceptable, 15-30% needs attention, >30% is problematic.

**Q: How often should I check this dashboard?**  
A: Weekly reviews recommended. Daily checks if actively managing data quality issues.

**Q: Can I filter by specific list or partner?**  
A: Use the table's built-in column filters to search/filter by partner name or description.

**Q: What should I do with cross-vertical duplicates?**  
A: These are accepted leads. Review if same consumers should be in multiple verticals. Not necessarily bad, but worth understanding.

**Q: How do I export data?**  
A: Click the "Export to CSV" button above each table. Opens in Excel or Google Sheets.
